    <p>This page is a demonstration of Web Workers. This is known to work in Internet Explorer 10+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Opera 10.6+, Safari for iOS 5+, and Chrome.</p>
    <p>Not all browsers allow the use of workers when a file is navigated to locally. If this example doesn't work in your browser, try running the files through a web server.</p>
